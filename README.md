The STADIC data visualization tool (StadicVis) is a cross-platform data-visualization software that is meant to visualize annual daylight simulation data generated by STADIC. StadicVis was written in Python with the help of third-party open-source plugins. 
The following are the primary dependencies for StadicVis:

1.	Python 2.7.11, 32-bit 

2.	Matplotlib 1.5.1 

3.	Numpy 1.11.0 

4.	SciPy 0.17.0 

5.	PyQT 4, Python 2.7, 32 bit 
6.	
Provided that the modules mentioned above are installed on the client system, StadicVis can by compiled into executable files by using PyInstaller or Py2exe. 
The syntax for compiling StadicVis on a windows system using Py2exe on a win-32 system is: 
python setup.py py2exe. 
The details for creating the setup.py file can be found at: http://py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step2 . The setup.py file should refer to stadicvis.py, the main script for launching the program.
