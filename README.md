##STADIC data visualization tool

The STADIC data visualization tool (StadicVis) is a cross-platform data-visualization software that is meant to visualize annual daylight simulation data generated by STADIC. StadicVis was written in Python with the help of third-party open-source plugins. 
The following are the primary dependencies for StadicVis:

1.	[Python 2.7.11, 32-bit ](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi)

2.	[Matplotlib 1.5.1 ](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/archive/v1.5.1.zip)

3.	[Numpy 1.11.0 ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/archive/v1.11.0.zip)

4.	[SciPy 0.17.0 ](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/archive/v0.17.0.zip)

5.	[PyQT 4, Python 2.7, 32 bit ](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.11.4/PyQt4-4.11.4-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.7-x32.exe)   


Provided that the modules mentioned above are installed on the client system, StadicVis can by compiled into executable files by using [PyInstaller ](https://codeload.github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/legacy.zip/develop)or [Py2exe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download). 

The syntax for compiling StadicVis on a windows system using Py2exe on a win-32 system is:   

`python setup.py py2exe`. 

The details for creating the setup.py file can be found at: http://py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step2 . The setup.py file should refer to stadicvis.py, the main script for launching the program.
